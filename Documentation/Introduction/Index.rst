What does it do?
================

This extension allows you to configure additional attributes for form fields. 

The extension "form" is very restrictive as to the attributes that can be added 
to the fields. Thus it is not possible to add the attribute "placeholder" which 
can be interesting in some form.
In some cases, it is also useful to add attributes like "data-x" for reuse with 
JavaScript.
